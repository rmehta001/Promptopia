About
<p>
  Created a Next.js-based app/repository that allows users to store and reuse prompts efficiently. These prompts can be accessed anytime from the homepage and can be labeled by topics. The platform helps ChatGPT users and other AI prompters copy prompts directly into the AI models they use.
â€¢ Helps users save up to 80% of time spent rewriting or recreating lengthy prompts by enabling quick access to stored and reusable templates. Improved page load speed by 50% and boosted organic traffic by 70% using Next.js SEO optimizations.

Why I used NextJS: Next.js supports Server-Side Rendering, which means pages are rendered on the server and sent to the client as fully-formed HTML. Search engine crawlers, which often struggle with JavaScript-heavy single-page applications (SPAs), can easily index these pre-rendered pages. <br><br>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
